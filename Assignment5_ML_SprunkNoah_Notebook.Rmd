This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

#The best methd to choose was the complete linkage because it had the 
#highesting structure for the data.

#Given that we used the complete linkage, I think the best number of 
#clusters to use is 4. When printing the dendrogram it shows 4
#distinct clusters.

#When choosing the best cluster for the school, I would go with cluster
#4 because it has realitely high protien with low sugars and moderate
#calories. It would be a better chose then having the cereals with the highest
#amounts of sugar available for lunch.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
